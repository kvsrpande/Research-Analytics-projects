## Overview

This project focuses on developing econometric models to predict sales at Boho Boutique's various locations using a comprehensive set of regressors. Boho Boutique, a retail establishment specializing in women's clothing and accessories, experienced rapid growth until March 2020. Due to financial constraints, the company now aims to expand only in locations with high revenue potential.

## Purpose of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate multiple models to identify the best one for predicting sales at Boho Boutique stores. The final model will be used to assess the sales potential at 20 different prospective locations, with recommendations provided on which locations are likely to generate high revenue.

## Key Findings

1. **Dependent Variable - Sales:** The project analyzed the dollar value of sales at each Boho Boutique location, cleaning up the data by identifying and removing outliers.

2. **Independent Variables:** Nine key regressors were defined, such as the presence of luxury malls, residential customer value, percentage of married adults, population growth since 2010, median household income, and the number of high-tier restaurants nearby. These variables were chosen based on their correlation with sales.

3. **Model Selection:** Five contender models were compared using multiple fit statistics, including R-square, adjusted R-square, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Model AJ6 was ultimately selected as the best model based on its performance.

4. **Model Interpretation:** The model suggests that factors such as proximity to luxury malls, median household income, and nearby high-tier restaurants have significant positive impacts on sales, while the number of people in school within a 2-mile radius has a slight negative impact.

5. **Recommendations:** Despite evaluating 20 potential locations, none were recommended for new store openings due to their inability to achieve high-revenue thresholds. However, the analysis emphasized the importance of high-tier restaurant proximity and luxury mall locations for future site selections.

## Recommendations from the Model

- Boho Boutiques located near high-tier restaurants and luxury malls have a very strong positive effect on sales.
- Areas with significant populations of individuals with bachelorâ€™s degrees, near movie theaters, gyms, or in households with incomes between $100,000 and $145,000, are also potential high-revenue locations.

## Usage

This repository contains the data, code, and analysis required to replicate the sales modeling process used in this project. It can serve as a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and decision-makers looking to understand and predict retail sales using econometric models.
