# Risk Factors Influencing the Development of Diabetes: An Econometric Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the various factors contributing to an individual's risk of developing diabetes using advanced econometric methods. By applying a probit regression model, this study identifies key variables such as age, lifestyle choices (e.g., alcohol consumption and junk food intake), stress, and pregnancy history that significantly impact the likelihood of being diagnosed with diabetes.

The analysis is based on data from a publicly available dataset and incorporates multiple measures of model fit to ensure robustness. The results provide actionable insights for public health initiatives aimed at reducing diabetes prevalence through targeted interventions and policy recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Econometric Analysis**: Utilizes a probit regression model to assess the impact of various independent variables on diabetes risk.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Offers empirical evidence on how lifestyle and demographic factors contribute to diabetes susceptibility.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Provides suggestions for public health strategies based on the study's findings.
- **Model Validation**: Includes multiple goodness-of-fit measures and statistical tests to validate the model's accuracy.

## Data Source
- **Diabetes Dataset 2019**: The analysis is based on the Diabetes Dataset 2019, which is available on Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tigganeha4/diabetes-dataset-2019).

## Usage
This repository can be used by researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to better understand the risk factors associated with diabetes. The insights from this study can guide the development of more effective prevention and management strategies for diabetes.
