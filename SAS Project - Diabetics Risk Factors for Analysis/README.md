# Diabetes Risk Factors Analysis

## Project Overview
This project employs a probit regression model to analyze the factors that influence the likelihood of developing diabetes. By examining variables such as age, lifestyle choices, and medical history, the study provides insights into the key risk factors associated with diabetes. The findings are intended to guide public health strategies and individual decisions aimed at preventing diabetes.

## Data
The data used in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tigganeha4/diabetes-dataset-2019). It includes various demographic and lifestyle variables that are analyzed to determine their impact on diabetes risk.

## Methodology
- **Probit Regression Model**: A statistical model used to estimate the probability of diabetes diagnosis based on the independent variables.
- **Marginal Effects**: Analysis of the impact of each variable on the probability of developing diabetes.

## Results
The analysis highlights several significant predictors of diabetes, including older age, regular consumption of junk food and alcohol, high levels of stress, and a history of pregnancy. The model's results are used to propose policy recommendations aimed at reducing the prevalence of diabetes.

## Policy Recommendations
- Implement routine diabetes screenings, especially for individuals over 40.
- Promote public health campaigns that encourage healthier dietary habits and regular physical activity.
- Provide stress management resources as part of public health initiatives.
- Educate pregnant individuals about the risks of gestational diabetes.

## Limitations
The study acknowledges limitations such as the reliance on a single dataset, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Future work could expand the dataset and include additional variables like income, education, and genetic factors.
